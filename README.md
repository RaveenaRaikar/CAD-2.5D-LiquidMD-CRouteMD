The FPGA CAD Framework for 2.5 architectures
==============================

An FPGA CAD framework focused on rapid prototyping of new CAD algorithms.
The framework is implemented in Java. At this moment packing, placement and routing algorithms are implemented in the framework. This branch contains the adaptations for 2.5D PnR.


What can I do with this tool flow?

Usage
---------------

Some parts of this toolflow require external packages. Please contact us if you want more information.

To calculate point to point delays, vpr is used (see option --vpr_command). When compiling vpr, the macro PRINT_ARRAYS has to be defined in "place/timing_place_lookup.c".
